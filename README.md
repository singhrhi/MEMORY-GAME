# MemoryGame

How to run the app : It's simple just open memory-game folder (shared with Nina) and double click the index.html. I have build the app in such a way so that it can be run by double clicking on the index.html.

Link for the code base is as follows,

Also some notes about the app.

stack: Angular 11, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap 4

Some considerations:
-Its a two player game.
-Player one will start the game
-Current player will be marked in green text
